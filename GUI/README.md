# GUI

GUI has been designed using Unity 3D. GUI has two distinct programs as follows:

- __Virtual Cube__

    Contains 3D virtual cube that can be manipulated using mouse or keyboard with "F, R, U, L, B, D" keys. Contains buttons to scramble, solve or Launch Camera.

- __Cube Detection__

    Contains Python code that detects cube using the trained cube detection model.

## TCP Communication Between Virtual Cube and Cube Detection
